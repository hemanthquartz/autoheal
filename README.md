Here’s simple slide content for Risk-Based Prioritization as a continuation of your risk matrix slide (pulled from the same Atlassian risk matrix guidance).  ￼

Slide Title: Risk-Based Prioritization (Picking What to Fix First)

What it means
	•	Risk-based prioritization means: we don’t treat all problems the same.
	•	We use the risk matrix to decide what needs attention first, based on:
	•	Likelihood (chance it happens)
	•	Impact (how bad it would be)  ￼

How we prioritize (easy rules)
	•	High Likelihood + High Impact = Top priority (do it now)
	•	Needs quick action and resources.  ￼
	•	High Impact but Lower Likelihood = Plan and prepare
	•	Keep it visible and have a backup plan.  ￼
	•	High Likelihood but Lower Impact = Fix when possible
	•	Small problems that happen often.  ￼
	•	Low Likelihood + Low Impact = Monitor or accept
	•	Just keep an eye on it.  ￼

What we do after prioritizing (action choices)
	•	Mitigate: reduce chance or damage
	•	Transfer: shift responsibility (example: insurance/vendor)
	•	Accept: acknowledge and monitor
	•	Avoid: change plan so risk doesn’t exist  ￼

Why this helps
	•	We focus time and budget on the most serious risks first.
	•	Everyone aligns because the matrix makes priority visible and easy to agree on.  ￼

If you want, I can also write a 2-minute talk track for this slide that flows naturally from your previous script.
