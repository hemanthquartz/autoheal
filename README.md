Subject: RE: Future State Architecture Discussion

Hi Mahesh,

Here are the Minutes of Meeting (MoM) from our discussion today regarding the future state architecture and data engineering strategy:

⸻

1. AWS Compute Layer
	•	Compare the available compute services in AWS (e.g., EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS, AWS Glue) that are suited for data processing workloads.
	•	Evaluate based on scalability, performance, cost, and ease of integration with existing data pipelines.

2. Data Engineering Purpose
	•	Focus on enabling principal data transformation workflows.
	•	Align with the organization’s broader cloud adoption goals.
	•	Prioritize scalable, cost-efficient, and growth-oriented architecture patterns.

3. Orchestration Tools
	•	Compare AWS Step Functions vs. Apache Airflow for managing and orchestrating data pipelines.
	•	Evaluate based on flexibility, integration with AWS services, and ease of maintenance.

4. Observability and Monitoring
	•	Assess current observability practices with a focus on Splunk.
	•	Explore implementing trigger-based automation to improve incident response.
	•	Enhance monitoring, logging, and alerting capabilities across the data platform.

5. DNS Considerations
	•	Review and address pending DNS-related tasks.
	•	Ensure these are incorporated into the broader infrastructure plan for seamless operations.

6. Meeting Follow-Up and Next Steps
	•	Share a detailed recap and action items with all participants.
	•	Distribute relevant documentation for review and feedback.
	•	Explore scheduling an in-person session for further discussion, if needed.
	•	Continue collaborating toward a unified and robust future-state architecture.
