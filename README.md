ðŸ”¹ Story 1: Create Common Lambda Layers for Shared Interface Utilities

Summary:
Create reusable Lambda Layers for the following utilities: db_thin_client, db_thick_client, lxml, and wranglers, to be used across all portfolios.

Description:
	â€¢	Package each utility into a standalone ZIP file as an independent Lambda Layer.
	â€¢	Ensure all layers are compatible with Python 3.12 runtime.
	â€¢	Create a dedicated CloudFormation template for each layer.
	â€¢	Export each layer as a resource that can be imported by other stacks (e.g., using Export and Fn::ImportValue).

Acceptance Criteria:
	â€¢	Four Lambda Layer ZIPs are created and validated.
	â€¢	Corresponding CFTs are available for deployment.
	â€¢	Each layer exports a resource name compatible with multi-stack usage.
	â€¢	Layers work without issues in Python 3.12 Lambdas.

ðŸ”¹ Story 2: Modify CFTs to Use New Common Lambda Layers and Upgrade to Python 3.12

Summary:
Update existing CloudFormation templates to use newly created common layers and upgrade Lambda runtime to Python 3.12.

Description:
	â€¢	Identify all Lambda functions currently using separate layer definitions for db_thin_client, db_thick_client, lxml, and wranglers.
	â€¢	Modify CFTs to use Fn::ImportValue and reference the new shared layers.
	â€¢	Upgrade the runtime of each Lambda to Python 3.12 in its template.

Acceptance Criteria:
	â€¢	All references to legacy layers replaced with references to shared layers.
	â€¢	All Lambdas updated to use python3.12.
	â€¢	Templates successfully validated and deployed in dev/test environments.

ðŸ”¹ Story 3: Functional Testing of Modified Lambdas Post Migration

Summary:
Perform regression testing on all modified Lambda functions after applying the new shared layers and upgrading the Python version.

Description:
	â€¢	Validate functionality and correctness of each Lambda function updated in the previous story.
	â€¢	Confirm successful execution paths and logging behavior.
	â€¢	Check compatibility and output integrity where the shared layer utilities are used.
	â€¢	Capture issues and coordinate with dev teams if needed.

Acceptance Criteria:
	â€¢	All Lambdas confirmed working correctly with the new layers and Python 3.12.
	â€¢	Errors (if any) triaged and fixed.
	â€¢	Logs validated in CloudWatch.
	â€¢	Approval sign-off from QA/stakeholders.
