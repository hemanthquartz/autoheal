Here are the key points of improvement for the technical architecture, with direct quotes:

1. Job Performance Optimization
Quote: "Some of the joints that we have... are not optimized correctly. And, you know, it consumes quite a lot of resources on Hadoop. And sometimes there are job failures to do that."

2. Dependency Management and Data Timeliness
Quote: "The timing of, you know, the data that we get from the other tables, usually we run into delays in the jobs because something upstream did not, you know, got built."

3. Eliminate Redundant Data Acquisition
Quote: "We need to find an equivalent table from the actual team who owns it and replace it. So that is one of the, you know, the key gaps that we have is that we are creating our own acquisitions and data lake at base jobs."

4. Limited Scalability of Current Infrastructure
Quote: "Hadoop is built on 51 nodes right now... it's still a fixed memory, right? So it's not, we cannot be scaled, you know, as we can do it in cloud."

5. Legacy Job Modernization
Quote: "Some of the older jobs that we have we support, which we didn't have time to redesign. That's where, you know, some of these issues are there."

These points provide a comprehensive view of potential improvements in the sales domain's technical architecture.




Analyzing the long-form discussion, here are comprehensive future improvement requirements:

Strategic Architecture Improvements:
1. Unified Multi-Domain Integration Strategy
Key Context: "These are different domains, what we have. Automotive domain, CRM domain, claims domain, travel domain"
Improvements:
- Create a holistic, cross-domain data integration framework
- Develop standardized architectural patterns across domains
- Implement enterprise-wide data governance model

2. Advanced Cloud Migration Roadmap
Key Context: "Platform modernization initiatives for 2025... we are planning to have all the things cut over by end of the year"
Improvements:
- Develop comprehensive multi-year cloud transformation strategy
- Create adaptive cloud migration methodology
- Implement intelligent workload assessment and migration tools

3. Intelligent Data Governance Framework
Key Context: "We have requirements for releasing things into production. It should have design approval, Business Glossary, data dictionary, data quality checks"
Improvements:
- Develop AI-powered governance automation
- Create dynamic compliance monitoring systems
- Implement predictive risk management frameworks

4. Comprehensive Master Data Management
Key Context: "Max is our customer system... customer records exist in Max before early stages within Salesforce and Onix"
Improvements:
- Design enterprise-wide master data strategy
- Create unified customer data platform
- Develop real-time data synchronization mechanisms

5. Advanced Reporting and Analytics Infrastructure
Key Context: "We need to build ACE data mod and MSEPMG data mods... downstream data mods requiring multiple source integrations"
Improvements:
- Implement self-service analytics platforms
- Create intelligent, adaptive reporting frameworks
- Develop automated insights generation systems

6. Flexible Data Architecture
Key Context: "We do not want lift and shift. We are going to redesign for cloud"
Improvements:
- Design cloud-agnostic data models
- Create modular, extensible data architectures
- Implement platform-independent data abstraction layers

7. Intelligent Data Integration
Key Context: "Different sources for generating leads - online, lists, referrals, mail-in, walk-in"
Improvements:
- Develop AI-driven data integration engines
- Create adaptive data ingestion frameworks
- Implement context-aware data mapping systems

8. Predictive Technology Rationalization
Key Context: "We have licenses for snowflake, redshift, Athena"
Improvements:
- Create technology portfolio optimization strategy
- Develop intelligent platform selection algorithms
- Implement continuous technology assessment frameworks

9. Enhanced Data Quality Management
Key Context: "Every tier has certain data governance and data integrity profiling requirements"
Improvements:
- Implement autonomous data quality monitoring
- Create predictive data anomaly detection
- Develop self-healing data validation mechanisms

10. Future-Ready Data Ecosystem
Key Context: "We are moving towards platform modernization across multiple domains"
Improvements:
- Design adaptive, event-driven architectural patterns
- Create enterprise-wide innovation acceleration framework
- Develop continuous technological transformation strategy

These improvements represent a holistic, strategic approach to transforming the data architecture, focusing on intelligence, flexibility, and continuous innovation.
