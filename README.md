Data Flow at a Glance

Ingestion  →  Transformation  →  Consumption

⸻

1. Simplified Data Flow
	•	Ingestion: Batch, CDC, Streaming (APIs, Logs, Files)
	•	Transformation: Cleansing, Masking, Aggregation, Schema alignment
	•	Consumption: Dashboards, APIs, Reports, Real-time insights

⸻

2. Core Technologies Used
	•	Platforms: Hadoop, Teradata, SQL Server
	•	Integration Tools: Informatica, BTEQ, Sqoop
	•	Analytics & Reporting: Tableau, Business Objects, Crystal Reports
	•	Programming & Governance: PySpark, Collibra, GCP

⸻

3. Critical Challenges

Data Governance & Quality
	•	Disparate standards across domains
	•	Limited lineage & traceability
	•	Missing, inconsistent data

Performance & Scale
	•	Latency (e.g. NCOA = 1-month delay)
	•	Large dataset bottlenecks
	•	Real-time alert responsiveness

Cost & Operations
	•	High AWS spend
	•	No archival/purging
	•	Redundant pipelines

Standardization & Access
	•	Inconsistent APIs/formats
	•	Poor visualization accessibility
	•	Fragmented external application support

⸻

Focus Forward:
	•	Align platforms and governance
	•	Enhance real-time visibility
	•	Standardize APIs and schemas
	•	Optimize storage, archival, and compute costs
