For a dataset of 150 TB, Teradata Parallel Transporter (TPT) is generally the preferred choice due to its high-performance capabilities and efficient handling of large data volumes. TPT’s ability to directly export data to Amazon S3 without intermediate storage can significantly reduce migration time and complexity.

However, if your migration also involves schema conversion or you’re moving to a different database system within AWS, incorporating AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) can be beneficial. In such cases, a hybrid approach using TPT for data extraction and SCT for schema conversion might offer the best of both worlds.![diagram-export-5-26-2025-12_35_05-AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c278bfff-ede8-4180-8749-a72598b0acdb)
