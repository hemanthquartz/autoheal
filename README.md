Here‚Äôs the summary of the architecture organized into two clear categories:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Ingestion Pattern ‚Äì Event Driven Architecture
	‚Ä¢	Staging Layer: Initial storage area where raw data lands.
	‚Ä¢	Event Detection: Events triggered upon new data arrival.
	‚Ä¢	Amazon SQS: Message queue for decoupling producer and consumer.
	‚Ä¢	Lambda (Data Synchronization):
	‚Ä¢	Picks messages from SQS.
	‚Ä¢	Triggers Glue Iceberg ingestion.
	‚Ä¢	Glue Iceberg REST Endpoint: Interface for writing to Iceberg tables.
	‚Ä¢	Data Lake: Stores raw and curated data.
	‚Ä¢	Glue Data Catalog: Updates metadata for discoverability.
	‚Ä¢	Control-M (Monitoring): Monitors ingestion flows and events.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è Processing Pattern ‚Äì Intraday Batch Architecture
	‚Ä¢	Step Function: Orchestrates batch processing steps.
	‚Ä¢	Lambda (Job Invocation): Initiates EMR job based on configurations.
	‚Ä¢	EMR on EC2: Executes Spark jobs or batch transformations.
	‚Ä¢	Outputs Written to:
	‚Ä¢	Base Layer
	‚Ä¢	Master Layer
	‚Ä¢	Glue Data Catalog: Updates metadata for processed datasets.
	‚Ä¢	Control-M (Triggering): Initiates processing jobs on schedule or condition.

üîê Unified Governance Layer (Supports Both Patterns)
	‚Ä¢	Collibra Platform:
	‚Ä¢	Data Catalog
	‚Ä¢	Data Governance
	‚Ä¢	Data Lineage
	‚Ä¢	Data Quality & Observability
