Based on the meeting transcript, the key challenges in the sales domain include:

1. Data Dependency Delays
- Jobs frequently get delayed due to upstream master table processing not completing on time
- This prevents timely delivery of data to target audiences

2. Hadoop Infrastructure Limitations
- Long-running jobs consume significant memory resources
- Limited scalability of the 51-node Hadoop cluster
- In-memory joins cause performance bottlenecks

3. Legacy Job Performance
- Older jobs (4-5 years old) have inefficient designs
- Some jobs run for multiple hours
- Newer redesigned jobs are more efficient, running in just a few minutes

4. Data Acquisition Challenges
- Currently maintaining some acquisition jobs independently
- Need to find equivalent tables from original data owners
- Requires redesigning existing jobs to use enterprise tables

5. Data Quality and Join Optimization
- Some joins are not optimized correctly
- Data issues need to be fixed within the same script
- Complex joins consume significant computational resources

These challenges primarily stem from legacy infrastructure, data dependency complexities, and the need for ongoing job optimization and redesign.
