Based on the meeting transcript, the key challenges for the finance domain include:

1. Complex Data Migration
- Multiple data sources (bread financials, MFS database, PMID)
- Data currently spread across Hadoop, Teradata, and AWS data lake
- Need to consolidate and migrate data to cloud platforms

2. Data Integration Complexity
- Different ingestion methods (SFTP, Atunity Click)
- Multiple products within financial domain (credit cards, PMID, potential BofA files)
- Ensuring data integrity during migration

3. Reporting and Usage Uncertainty
- Unclear current usage of data in Hadoop
- Need to understand reporting requirements before migration
- Potential upcoming 2025 initiative for bread financials reporting

4. Technical Transition
- Planned decommissioning of Hadoop and Teradata
- Selecting appropriate cloud migration tools (Click vs DMS)
- Maintaining near real-time data capture during transition

5. Ownership and Coordination
- Multiple teams involved (renders team, current support team)
- Need for clear communication and handover between teams
- Ensuring comprehensive understanding of current data landscape

These challenges require careful planning, stakeholder collaboration, and a detailed migration strategy.
