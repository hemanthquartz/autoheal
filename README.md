Slide Title: Risk Matrix (Super Simple)

What is a Risk Matrix?
	•	A risk matrix is a picture chart that helps us see which problems could happen and how serious they could be.  ￼
	•	It helps teams spot, compare, and pick which risks to handle first.  ￼

How it works (2 lines)
	•	It’s a grid with two sides:
	•	Likelihood = How likely it is to happen
	•	Impact = How big the trouble is if it happens  ￼
	•	Risks in the top-right corner (high likelihood + high impact) need fast action.  ￼

Steps to make one
	1.	List risks (all possible problems).  ￼
	2.	Give each risk a score for Likelihood and Impact (like Low/Medium/High).  ￼
	3.	Plot each risk on the grid (Likelihood vs. Impact).  ￼
	4.	Decide what to do:
	•	Mitigate (reduce it)
	•	Transfer (give/share it with someone else, like insurance)
	•	Accept (watch it, do nothing for now)
	•	Avoid (change plan so it can’t happen)  ￼

Tiny example (easy)
	•	Risk: Server downtime
	•	Likelihood: Medium
	•	Impact: High
	•	Put it on the grid → treat it as important.  ￼

Why we use it
	•	Makes it easier to decide what to fix first.  ￼
	•	Helps everyone talk about risks using the same picture.  ￼
	•	Supports planning actions so problems don’t surprise us.  ￼
