Ravi, the delay in my salary has made things very difficult for me financially. I really enjoy working with TCS, but without timely pay, I’m struggling to manage my bills and expenses. My November salary is still pending, and I haven’t received any updates.

Plus, the most disheartening part of all is that, it is affecting my performance with lot of demotivation. I am not able to focus at work with the anxiety that there won’t be timeIy salary. I can feel it myself.

Because of this situation, I’ve decided to quit and look for other opportunities. Please consider this as my 1 week notice. I hope you understand, and I would really appreciate it if you can help me with the pending payments.

I really really feel bad that I am quitting. I was actually thinking of a full time when I started but that’s not happening in reality.
